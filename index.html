            <h2>A Plague Tale: Requiem</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to its predecessor, Requiem is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective.
                In the game, the player assumes control of Amicia and must face against both soldiers from the French
                Inquisition and hordes of rats that are spreading the black plague. Gameplay is largely similar to the
                first game, though the combat system is significantly expanded. Amicia is equipped with weapons such as
                a knife to stab enemies, a sling that can be used to throw rocks, and a crossbow which allows her to
                easily defeat armoured opponents. Crossbow bolts, throwing pots, and rocks can be combined with
                alchemical mixtures. In addition to Ignifer and Extinguis, which allows the player to light and
                extinguish flame respectively, the game introduces tar, which increases the radius of the light source,
                and can be used to ignite enemies.

                Locations are also larger in Requiem, giving players additional options to progress. Stealth is expanded
                in Requiem. Unlike Innocence, Amicia would not die after being hit once by enemies. She can also return
                to stealth after she was discovered by enemies, and counter their attacks if she gets too close to them.
                Amicia's brother Hugo, who has a connection to the plague, can use an ability named "Echo" which reveals
                the locations of enemies through walls. Hugo can also control the hordes of rats to overwhelm enemies.
                Similar to the first game, the rats, which are light-averse, play a huge role in the game. Amicia and
                Hugo must stay in the light, or they will be devoured by the rats. Amicia can use the rats to her
                advantage, manipulating them to solve puzzles, or even lure them to kill enemies.

                The game also features a progression system in which the player will be awarded with additional skills
                and abilities. Stealth players will unlock skills that allows them to sneak around more efficiently,
                while those who prefer a more lethal approach will unlock additional combat skills. The player's
                gears and equipment can also be upgraded at workbenches.
